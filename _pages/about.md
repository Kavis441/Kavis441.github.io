# 📝 Research Interests
My research interests include complex document analysis, particularly for historical documents and text processing for low-resource languages. I have contributed to both industry-driven research projects and published papers in leading peer-reviewed conferences and journals in my fields of expertise.
# 📝 A Brief Reflection on My Research Journey
My name is Nimol, and I am from Cambodia. I have been actively involved in research and development since 2011. My early work focused on web applications for search engines at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, specifically the Khmer Semantic Search Engine, developed between 2011 and 2016. This project was a groundbreaking effort to address the complexities of processing the Khmer language, a challenge even Google struggled with at the time. I also worked on Khmer search engines and keyword extraction from Khmer documents, including PDF-scanned images. Between 2013 and 2017, I contributed to a national research and development initiative for a financial document system. This project, which included advanced search tools, keyword extraction, and OCR, was supported by the Cambodian Ministry of Education and funded by the World Bank. Since 2017, I have been conducting research in computer vision and pattern recognition at institutions such as the University of Mons in Belgium, FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany and the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the University of Science and Technology. Additionally, I have worked on analyzing historical palm leaf manuscripts, focusing on document analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition.

Although my achievements might not compare to those of top-tier researchers, they are deeply meaningful to me. Born into a family with limited resources, I earned most of my degrees through competitive scholarships, which I achieved through hard work and dedication. Despite these accomplishments, I remain eager to gain more experience and continue learning from experts and researchers around the world.

[Historical Palm Leaf Manuscript Analysis](https://nimol89.github.io/PLA/)

[**Project**](https://nimol89.github.io/PLA/)

The Palm Leaf Manuscript Dataset is a unique compilation of historical scripts from Southeast Asia, representing centuries of rich cultural heritage. It features diverse scripts such as Sundanese, Balinese, and Khmer, traditionally used to document religious texts, historical records, and cultural narratives on palm leaves.

[Khmer Document Retrieval](https://nimol89.github.io/kse/)

[**Project**](https://nimol89.github.io/PLA/)
For Khmer documents, an effective tool is needed to extract essential keywords and facilitate accurate searches. Despite the daily generation of significant Khmer content, Cambodians struggle to find necessary documents due to the lack of an effective semantic searching tool. We developed tools for search engines, and keyword extraction.
